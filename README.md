# The project is an exercise in using React with Redux Toolkit.

The project is from Dave Gray's "React Redux Toolkit for Beginners".  It is a learning activity.  Working this project along with reading official Redux documentation is where I finally got comfortable with Redux.  Redux Toolkit syntax is a bit sparse, which may be desirable for developers who understand the system.  Reading the Redux documentation that explains the original, more verbose boiler plate approach has been very helpful.

This project includes using axios and thunks to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to development website that supports learning projects.

React Router v6 is also used to manage different pages.
