# The project is an exercise in using React with Redux Toolkit.

The project is from Dave Gray's "React Redux Toolkit for Beginners".  It is a learning activity.  Working this project along with reading official Redux documentation is where I finally got comfortable with Redux.  Redux Toolkit syntax is a bit sparse, which may be desirable for developers who understand the system.  Reading the Redux documentation that explains the original, more verbose boiler plate approach has been very helpful.
